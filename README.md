# Car-Price-Prediction-2021
Hello there!
This project is a Machine Learning project using the Random forest regressor algorithm. It uses the dataset from the Car Dekho website available on Kaggle. It predicts the price of a car based on different parameters like model year, automatic/manual, fuel type, etc.
I have created a web application using the languages  Python, HTML, and CSS using the Flask framework.
